        // In programming we often take something and then extend it.For example we might want to create a user object and "admin" and "guest" will be slightly modified variants of it

        //============================= Protypes and proto ==========================

        // Prototype: Javascript objects have a special property called prototype that is either null or references anoher object.
        // When we try to read a property from prototype and its missing, Javascript automatically takes it from the protoype.This is called "prototypal inheritence"

        // Setting Prototype: We can set prototype by setting __proto__ Now if we read a property from the object which is not in object and is present in the prototype, Javascrpt will take it from prototype
        // If we have a method in object, it will be called from the object. If its missing in object and present in prototype, its called from the prototype

        let a = {
            // name: "hanxla",
            section: "CK-1",
            // run: ()=>{
            //     console.log("SELF RUN")
            // }
        }
        console.log(a)

        let p = {
            run: ()=>{
                console.log("RUN")
            }
        }

        a.__proto__ = p

        p.__proto__ = {         // A prototype can also has a prototype
            name : "Mazhar"  
        }


        a.run()
        console.log(a.name)
