 //============================= Hoisting =================================

// Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the delarations to the top of the code before execution.

// Variables can thus be refernced before they are declared in javascript.

// Javascript only hoists declarations, not initializations. The variable will be undefined until the line where its initialized is reached.

// Hoisting with let and var:
// With let and var hoisting is different 

//console.log(num)  // Error if let or const // With var undefined is print
//let num = 6;

// function expression and class expression are not hoisted 

// let a;

// Following two lines will run successfully due to JavaScript hoisting

console.log(a)
a = 6
  
//// function expressions and class expressions are not hoisted in the same way as function declarations.////

// greet()
var greet = function() {
    console.log("Good morning")
}
greet()
   // Error with "let" or "const" but with "var" ,"undefined" will be print
var a ; // Declaration hoisted to the top but initialization is not
console.log(a)
