//============================ Method Overriding ===============================

// In JavaScript, method overriding is a concept where a child class provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class. This allows you to customize the behavior of a method in the child class while still maintaining the overall structure and functionality defined in the parent class.

// Keep in mind that super can only be used within methods of a subclass and is used to reference the superclass and call its methods. If you attempt to use super outside of a class method or in a non-derived class, it will result in a syntax error

class Employee{
    login(){
        console.log("Employee has logged in")
    }
    sigin(){
        console.log("Employee has signed in")
    }
    requestLeaves(x){
        console.log(`Employee has granted ${x} leaves`)
    }
}

class Programmer extends Employee{
    requestCoffee(x){
        console.log(`Employee has granted ${x} Cups of Coffees`)
    }
    requestLeaves(x){
        super.requestLeaves(9)
        console.log("One extra is granted")
    }
}

let hanzla = new Programmer
hanzla.login
hanzla.requestCoffee(17)
hanzla.requestLeaves(5)

//========================= Overriding Constructor ==============================
// With a constructor, things are a bit tricky/different. According to the specification, if a class extends another class and has no constructor , then the following empty constructor is generated:
    class Animal{
        constructor(){

        }

        run(){
            console.log("Animal is running")
        }
    }
    class Monkey extends Animal{

        // auto generated
        // Happens if we don't write our own constructor
         constructor(...arg){
         super(...arg)
        }
        eat(){
            console.log("Monkey is eating Banana")
        }
    }
    // Constructor in inheriting classes must call super(...) and do it before using this 
    // So we can also use super.method() in a Child method to call Parent method
